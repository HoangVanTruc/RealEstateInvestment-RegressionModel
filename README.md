# RealEstateInvestment-RegressionModel
Project Objective: Analysis of Factors Influencing Real Estate Investment Decisions at Nam Long Investment Corporation Using Regression Models in R

Team size: 5
The dataset used in this project is a **simulated dataset**

The primary goal of this project is to identify the key factors affecting investment decisions, build an appropriate regression model based on the collected data, and evaluate the model's accuracy to make conclusions and recommendations.

Specific Objectives:
Identify Factors Influencing Real Estate Investment Decisions:

Location: The proximity to city centers, transport convenience, and accessibility to public amenities (schools, hospitals, shopping centers, parks) are critical factors in investment decisions. Properties with prime locations tend to attract higher investment due to their potential for high returns.
Property Size and Design: The size of the property, number of rooms, and modern design with in-house amenities significantly impact the investment decision. Larger properties with contemporary design and facilities are more appealing.
Infrastructure and Legal Framework: The quality of infrastructure (roads, utilities) and the legal status (ownership certificates, clear zoning) of the property are fundamental in evaluating the potential of a project and ensuring investment safety and stability.
Build Regression Models for Analysis:

Linear Regression Model: To explore the relationships between factors such as location, size, infrastructure, and legal status and their influence on investment decisions.
Polynomial Regression Model: To better capture non-linear relationships, especially in cases where the factors have complex or strong interactions.
Evaluate Model Accuracy and Effectiveness:

Use evaluation metrics such as regression coefficients, RÂ² values, and F-tests to assess the effectiveness of the regression models.
Conduct error analysis and validation tests to evaluate the reliability of the models in predicting investment decisions.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide a clearer understanding of the key factors that affect Nam Long Group's investment decisions, thereby supporting the company in developing effective, data-driven investment strategies for sustainable growth.
